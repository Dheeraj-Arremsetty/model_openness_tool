## Contributing Models to the MOT

If you'd like to contribute a new model or changes to an existing model via GitHub, please follow
the steps below to ensure your model is validated and accepted.

### Prerequisites

Before you start contributing, ensure you have the following installed and
set up in your local environment:

- **PHP**: Required to run the validation script.
- **Composer**: Used to manage project dependencies.

If you donâ€™t already have PHP and Composer installed, you can find installation
instructions on their respective websites:
- [PHP Installation](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php)
- [Composer Installation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)

Once you have these tools installed, proceed with the following steps.

### Steps to Contribute a Model

1. **Fork the repository**
   - First, fork the main repository to your personal GitHub account. 
   - Clone the forked repository to your local machine for development.

2. **Add your model**
   - Place your model file (`<your-model>.yml`) in the `models` directory of the repository.
   - Ensure your model adheres to the schema located at `schema/mof_schema.json`.

3. **Validate your model locally**
   - Before creating a Pull Request, validate your model locally to ensure it conforms to the project's rules.
   - Run the following command to validate your model:
     ```
		 composer install
     php scripts/validate-model.php models/<your-model>.yml
     ```
   - This will check for any issues with your model before you submit it.

4. **Submit a pull request**
   - Once your model passes local validation, commit your changes and push them to your fork.
   - Submit a Pull Request (PR) to the main repository, ensuring the model is in the `models/` directory.
   
5. **Approval process**
   - After submitting your PR, a maintainer will manually review and approve it.
   - Once the PR is merged, the GitHub workflow will automatically validate the model again and publish it, provided it passes validation.

### Additional Notes

- Ensure that your model adheres to the schema defined in `schema/mof_schema.json`.
- Running local validation before submitting a PR can save time and ensure quicker approval of your contribution.
