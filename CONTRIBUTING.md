Thank you for contributing to the MOT.

## Contributing Models to the MOT

If you'd like to contribute a new model or changes to an existing model via GitHub, please follow
the steps below to ensure your model is validated and accepted.

### Steps to Contribute a Model

1. **Fork the repository**
   - First, fork the main repository to your personal GitHub account. 
   - Clone the forked repository to your local machine for development.

2. **Add your model**
   - Place your model file (`<your-model>.yml`) in the `models` directory of the repository.
   - Ensure your model adheres to the schema located at `schema/mof_schema.json`. (see note below on validation)

4. **Submit a Pull Request**
   - Once your model file passes local validation, commit your changes and push them to your fork.
   - Submit a Pull Request (PR) to the main repository, ensuring the model is in the `models/` directory.
   
5. **Approval process**
   - After submitting your PR, a maintainer will manually review and approve it.
   - Once the PR is merged, the GitHub workflow will automatically validate the model again and publish it, provided it passes validation.

### Validating your model file locally

Before creating a Pull Request, if your model file wasn't generated using the MOT Model evaluation download function, you should validate your model file locally to ensure it conforms to the project's rules.

**Note:** Ensuring that your model file adheres to the schema defined in `schema/mof_schema.json` by doing a local validation before submitting a PR can save time and ensure quicker approval of your contribution.

To do so, follow these steps:

- Ensure you have the following installed and set up in your local environment:

  - **PHP**: Required to run the validation script.
  - **Composer**: Used to manage project dependencies.

- If you donâ€™t already have PHP and Composer installed, you can find installation
instructions on their respective websites:
  - [PHP Installation](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php)
  - [Composer Installation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)

- Once you have these tools installed, proceed with the following command to validate your model file:
   ```
  composer install
  php scripts/validate-model.php models/<your-model>.yml
   ```

  This will check for any issues with your model file before you submit it.

## Contributing to the MOT software

To submit bug fixes and improvements to the MOT software please follow these steps:

* Fork the repository on GitHub.
* Create a new branch for your feature or fix.
* Install **PHP** and **Composer** as describe above to test locally your changes.
* Submit a pull request with a detailed description of your changes.

Note that all changes to the code should carry a sign-off.

See the [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) file for more information on how to setup your environment to run MOT.
